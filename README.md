# chomper
A MIT xPro coding boot camp project

An animation of a popular chomping ball character that will remain anonymous in case it might be a copyright violation.  I'm not a lawyer and I don't play one on TV.

## Goal
The goal of the original assignment was to control a "PacMan" image to simulate it moving across the screen and reversing direction using the HTML DOM.  The original upload of this was coded to meet that requirement and mostly matched the original lesson plan.  The only difference being a separate function to determine if the character was at the boundary box.  I do not like one-line functions unless they're called repeatedly.  This was called a single time and there was no call for abstraction.
